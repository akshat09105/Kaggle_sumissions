## 💡 Viewing Invalid Notebooks?

Some notebooks were **flagged invalid by Kaggle** and might not load in the Kaggle UI.  
But don't worry — here's how to still view and run them:

### 🔄 Google Colab Workaround

1. Open the folder containing the invalid notebook (e.g., `Titanic-Survival/invalid_submission.ipynb`)
2. Download the notebook to your local device
3. Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
4. Click **File → Upload notebook** and select the `.ipynb` file
5. Run the notebook without issues!

_These notebooks are fully functional and usually invalid only due to notebook metadata or Kaggle UI quirks._

## 📈 My Learning Strategy

I don’t just solve — I learn, analyze, and iterate. Each submission focuses on:

- ✅ Problem understanding
- ✅ Feature engineering
- ✅ Model selection and tuning
- ✅ Error analysis
- ✅ Final insights and conclusions

You’ll find detailed comments and structured notebooks that reflect my learning mindset and logical approach.
